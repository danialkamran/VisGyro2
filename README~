This is the second version of VisGyro code.
The main differences from the first version:
Fundamental matrix estimation has been speeded up using GPU implementation.
Feature detection, description and matching has been improved using the LibViso (Andreas Geiger) feature matcher.
The code doesnot have any dependancy on the OpenCV libraries
You can estimate the orientation using two methos: 1) Fundamental Matrix 2)Bearing vector rotation estimation
